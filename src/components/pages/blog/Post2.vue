    <h3>My First 6 months as a Developer</h3>
    <h4>The Beginning: Unchartered Territory</h4>
    <p>
        While my fellow bootcampers were diligently searching for their first developer job upon completing the bootcamp, I
        found myself in a fortunate position where mine was already secured. My employers at the time had given me the
        opportunity to transition into their Engineering Department. This allowed me to relax a bit during the festive
        period, and I was filled with energy and excitement as I joined my new team on the first working day of the new
        year. The team I was joining was relatively new. They had previously operated as an independent software development
        agency until they were acquired about 10 months earlier. They were based in a co-working space just a few hundred
        meters from the main office where I used to work, and it felt like I was joining an entirely new company.

    <h4>Overcoming Challenges: The Learning Curve</h4>
    <p>
        My first two weeks were quite enjoyable. Given that the product I would eventually work on was an integration
        platform built with Laravel and Vue.js (two frameworks I hadn't used before), my line manager assigned me the task
        of building a basic Currency Converter app to familiarize myself with these technologies. The capabilities these
        frameworks offered were extensive, especially Laravel, which was a significant leap from the Slim framework I was
        accustomed to. Even as I write this six months later, I still feel like I've only scratched the surface of the
        Laravel framework. It was humbling to hear from my colleagues that they were continuously learning new things,
        despite having worked with it for over two years.
        <br>
        To aid my learning, I was provided with a Laracasts membership, which, in my opinion, is a valuable resource for
        mastering Laravel and its surrounding ecosystem. However, the majority of my learning occurred on the job with the
        support of my team. After my brief 'training' period, I was assigned to 2nd Line Support to assist my more
        experienced colleagues, allowing them to focus on adding new functionality to the product. Our project manager even
        gave me the nickname 'Batman' for taking on this role. When I wasn't addressing support tickets, I was tasked with
        improving the test coverage of our application. While these tasks may not have seemed glamorous, they played a
        pivotal role in helping me understand our codebase better. I learned how to write more advanced unit tests using
        techniques like mocking and how to craft clean code that is easier to test and maintain. As I became more
        comfortable navigating the project, I seized the opportunity to build some new features.

    <h4>An Abrupt Ending: Navigating through Challenging Times</h4>
    <p>
        Just as I was starting to gain confidence in my knowledge of the codebase, Laravel, and feeling like I was making a
        meaningful contribution to the team, my time with the company was unexpectedly cut short. The company began to feel
        the impact of the recent economic downturn and, like many other tech companies, had to reduce its workforce. It was
        a regrettable turn of events because I had genuinely been enjoying my role. I was learning something new every day,
        and my team was truly exceptional. They generously dedicated their time to support me and held the highest standards
        for the code we were developing. I couldn't have asked for a better group of people to kickstart my career in tech.

    <h4>Looking Ahead: The Road to Mastery</h4>
    <p>
        As I reflect on the past six months as a developer, I'm filled with gratitude for the experiences and knowledge I've
        gained. I've come to realize that development is a lifelong journey, an ever-evolving field where learning never
        ceases. To consolidate what I've learned in my first developer role and to expand my skill set, I've decided to take
        a short break over the summer. During this time, I plan to revisit Vue to refresh my Frontend skills, and I'm
        excited to delve into the realm of designing, deploying, and managing applications in the cloud, which is still
        somewhat unfamiliar to me.
