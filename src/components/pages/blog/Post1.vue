    <h3>Why I decided to become a Software Developer</h3>
    <p>
        I never had a convincing answer to the question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” throughout my
        childhood.
        At school Physics was my favourite subject and I was half decent at Maths. Most of my peers at my
        college, including all my close friends, were planning to go to University and it seemed like the best
        option for me also at the time.
        I managed to convince myself that Mechanical Engineering would be a good career fit for me. I’m a big
        fan of the Iron Man movies and dreamed about becoming the real life version of Tony Stark.
        “I’m going to design nuclear fusion reactors and solve climate change!” I thought to myself as I started
        writing my personal statement.

        Unsurprisingly, my naive expectations were not met and two and a half years into my Master’s Degree I
        faced the reality that I had gone down the wrong path.
        Unfortunately I still had no idea what I wanted to do instead so I dragged myself through the next 3
        semesters to complete the degree.
        Towards the end of my final semester, whilst the whole world was in lockdown from the COVID 19 pandemic,
        my luck started to change.
        Two of my housemates were friends with someone working at a startup operating in the e-commerce
        fulfilment space. They were looking to hire a second Graduate Process Engineer.
        Long story short I managed to secure that job and they are still my employers at the time of writing.
        The first 12 months were really exciting.
        I was learning a lot and when I transitioned into the Logistics Manager role I got exposure to a lot of
        other departments.
        With the rapid growth of the business and the UK leaving the EU my job started to become more demanding,
        repetitive and less technical however.
        To overcome the three issues I realised that I needed to work smarter. I needed to automate the mundane
        tasks and/or build tools to empower other people to resolve queries themselves - I needed to learn
        coding!
        I started to learn Python in my spare time because it has useful libraries for data processing. After a
        few weeks I managed to write a script which automatically generated a report that I would make at the
        end of each month.
        It turned a 4 hour manual job into a 5 min task - it could have been even faster if I knew how to write
        functions properly. That was the moment I realised programming would be a worthwhile skill to develop.
        I started to chat with my colleagues in the Software Engineering department. They are a super friendly
        and enthusiastic bunch and pointed me to some really good resources online to develop my skills.
        After a few months going through this material I realised that I had a genuine interest in Web
        development and wanted to pursue it as a career.

    <p>A few of my colleagues were also career switchers like me and highly recommended the bootcamp they completed - the
        Full Stack Track by the iO Academy. It is a 16 week in-person bootcamp. The maximum size of the cohort is 8 people
        (this is the typical size of real software engineering teams) and several weeks throughout the course were dedicated
        to group projects. I was sold. I applied for the next available course straight away and got accepted.</p>
